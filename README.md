## **HW-two** : 
Requirements:
Your application must contain the the following functionality:
1. Login, Registration, and Logout (you’re only building front-end components, so these do
not actually need to validate or persist credentials.)
2. A Todolist containing individual Todo items
3. A form to add new Todo to the Todolist.
4. An individual Todo item should consist of the following data/props:
a. title (this is a required field, form should not submit without it)
b. description (this is an optional field, it is not required to submit the form)
c. author (this is the currently logged in user’s username)
d. dateCreated (this field is set dynamically when the form is submitted – research
the JS lib method Date.now())
e. complete (a boolean initially set to false when a Todo is created)
f. dateCompleted (this field is set dynamically when the form is submitted)
5. When rendering a Todo a checkbox should be used to display the value of the “complete”
field. Checking/unchecking the checkbox should update the value of the “complete” field
appropriately. The dateCompeleted field should also be updated (again, dynamically
utilizing Date.now()).
